# Size Gastruloid Project
Scripts that contain the analysis and plots in the publication [Paper](link).
## Description
This repository is divided into the bulk RNA-Seq pipeline and markers UMAPs visualization.

- **Bulk RNA-Seq**: this folder contains the pipeline for the preprocessing, alignment and downstream analysis for the sequencing data. 
- **Markers UMAPs**: this folder contains the scripts for the analysis and visualization of gene markers of scRNA-Seq gastruloid and embryo data from literature.
