# Size Gastruloid Bulk RNA-Seq
Complete bulk RNA-Seq workflow from raw fastq to downstream analysis of the [Paper]((https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40848835/)).
## Description
This repository contains the code related to the analysis performed on gastruloid sequencing data.

- **Preprocessing and aligment**: this folder contains the code and steps followed to get from the raw `fastq` files into the bulk count data.
- **Analysis**: this folder contains the scripts for the downstream analysis of the counts data.

> **Note**: if not interested on realigning the data, you can start by directly downloading the processed countdata.
